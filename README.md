## Project Descriptions

### Fligth Deals ðŸ›«
This project retrieves flight deal data from a Google Sheet via the Sheety API. It updates missing IATA codes using a Amadeus API, finds the cheapest flights based on user-defined criteria, and sends notifications via SMS and email if a low price is found. The notifications can be sent to multiple recipients.
### GUI Quizz ðŸ¤”
A GUI-based trivia quizz game that fetches true/false questions from the OpenTrivia Database API. The game uses Tkinter for its interface and manages questions and scoring.
### Rain Alert â˜”
This project fetches weather forecast data from the OpenWeatherMap API to determine if rain is expected. If rain is forecasted (based on weather condition codes), the app sends an SMS alert via Twilio.
### Workout TrackingðŸ‘Ÿ
A workout tracker that uses the Nutritionix API to convert a natural language exercise description into structured workout data. The project logs details such as the exercise name, duration, and calories burned into a Google Sheet via the Sheety API.
